        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a father of two children. My spouse supports me in my various endeavors. 
          I have been working in law enforcement for the last 5 ½ years. I served as a detention deputy with the Twin Falls County Sheriff\’s Office for 1 ½ years before 
          transitioning to Lincoln County as a Patrol Deputy. Currently, I hold the position of Chief Deputy.<br><br>
          In my spare time, I engage in activities such as hunting, fishing, working with cars, and computers.
           I have an interest in technology and possess experience in cabling, as well as building and troubleshooting computers. 
           In my role as Chief Deputy, one of my responsibilities includes maintaining and resolving issues related to office computers, which ranges from 
           fixing printers in patrol vehicles to assisting with applications that manage our reports system.<br><br>
          I have also started learning programming using Codecademy.com. One project involves building a personal portfolio site. I have practiced HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and am currently learning React. Though new to this field, I aim to expand my knowledge as much as possible and am enjoying the challenge.
